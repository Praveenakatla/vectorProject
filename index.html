    <h1>Who is ratan tata</h1>
        <p>
        Ratan Naval Tata is presently the Executive Chairman of Tata Sons, the Tata Group's parent organization, which owns Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors, Tata Power, Indian Hotels, Tata Steel, and Tata Teleservices. He was nurtured and grew up by his grandmother when his parents divorced when he was only ten years old, and after graduating from college, he got actively involved in the family-owned company. In 1962, he started his job at Tata Steel, where he learned about his family's company.
        
        He dominated for many years in his field and still contributed with full intensity. He was the Chairman of Tata Group from 1990 to 2012 and interim Chairman from October 2016 to 2017, and after that, he went on to manage the company's charity trusts. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2008 and the Padma Bhushan in 2000, two of India's highest civilian prizes. It is a glimpse that we have discovered about him so far. Let's get deep into the detail now.</p>
